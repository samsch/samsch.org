## Development
I build web apps, specializing in user interfaces, user experience, and accessibilty. In particular, I know how to "dumb-down" an interface so that less tech-savvy users can feel comfortable. On the development side, I write code that is heavily isolated, single responsibilty, and easy to delete.

## Skills and Tools
Beside the common web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), these are tools I regularly use:
- TypeScript
- React
- Preact
- RxJS
- Ramda
- Astro
- Next.js
- Babel
- Webpack
- SCSS (Sass)
- ESLint
- Dependency Cruiser
- VSCodium
- Node.js
- Express
- Lodash
- Laravel/PHP
- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Many others...
