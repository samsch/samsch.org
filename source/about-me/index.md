## Development
I build web apps, specializing in user interfaces (UI and UX) and data management. In particular, I know how to "dumb-down" an interface so that less tech-savvy users can feel comfortable.

## Tutoring, mentoring
I offer private tutoring and guidance for learning and working with the tools and languages in web development.

## Skills and Tools
Beside the common web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), these are tools I regularly use:
- React
- Babel
- Webpack
- Sass (SCSS)
- ESLint
- VSCode
- Node.js
- Express
- Lodash
- Laravel/PHP
- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Many others...

You can check out my open source work on [my Github profile](https://github.com/samsch).

Send me an email, message me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DtfkPhU) or Matrix (@samsch.org:matrix.org), or you can find me hanging in #reactjs, #javascript, and #Node.js on Libera (IRC). I can tell you about projects I've worked on, technical solutions, or we can just connect and see where it goes.
