## Development
I build web apps, specializing in React and Redux.

## Tutoring, mentoring
I offer private tutoring and guidance for learning and working with the tools and languages in web development.

## Skills and Tools
Beside the common web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), these are tools I regularly use:
- React
- Redux
- Lodash
- Babel
- Webpack
- Sass (SCSS)
- Atom
- ESLint
- Symfony/PHP
- SQL
- NodeJS
- Many others...

I have several boilerplate or example projects on Github, which you can find from [my Github profile](https://github.com/samsch), using the name pattern `basic-*`, where "*" is something like "react", "react-redux". Most of these use Webpack and Babel, with very little project-specific details and configuration, but including basic production necessities.
